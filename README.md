# Pizza Factory Game
The purpose of this game is to teach the value of iteration, feedback and continuous improvement.

## PowerShell Implementation
Download the game script using PowerShell:

```Invoke-WebRequest -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shotolab/pizzaFactory/main/pizzaFactory.ps1 -OutFile pizzaFactory.ps1```

If the script won't run you may have to allow remote script execution:
1. Run PowerShell as Admin
2. Type ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```
